## What's this?

This is... nothing. I'm just re-inventing the wheel only to have slightly better
understanding about what [extendr](https://extendr.github.io/) does.

## Random thoughts

### Error Handling

This framework uses [tagged pointer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagged_pointer) to indicate the error.
This requires some wrappers, but the advantage is that we don't need to pass additional data
and these bit operations should be cheap.

See [extendr/extendr#278](https://github.com/extendr/extendr/issues/278) for more discussion.

### Protection

I implemented the doubly-linked list method, which [cpp11 uses](https://cpp11.r-lib.org/articles/internals.html#protection).
Now I'm not sure if this fits extendr; probably its current implementation aims for
parallel processing, so it needs a hashmap to prevent collisions. But, I think
it's not a good idea to use R's C API concurrently anyway, so this should be probably
enough.

### Read-only and writable versions of wrappers

cpp11 provides the read-only by default, and [the writable version](https://cpp11.r-lib.org/articles/motivations.html#copy-on-write-semantics)
as an option.It seems a good idea to distinguish the external SEXPs and the
"owned" SEXPs because we have control, when to protect and unprotect, only over
the latter one.

### Do we really want embedded usages?

Regarding the concurrency, I'm wondering if it would be simpler if extendr give
up supporting embedded usages. Yes, extendr is not only about R packages. It also
provides functionalities to embed R in Rust like [this one](https://github.com/yutannihilation/extendr-tide-api-server-example).
This is great, but, on the other hand, this means we have to care a lot of things.
But, how careful we try to be, concurrency is a tough job.

A lot of tests have failed because of various problems related to concurrency.
Every time we encountered such a failure, we place `single_threaded()` here and
there. But, could all of them really happen inside an R package? If extendr gives
up supporting embedded usages, can our life be simpler a bit?

### Generatinb bindings by CLI

Extendr embeds the functionality to generate the R bindings and call entries.
But, might it be easier to generate them by using an external CLI? I actually
need this because I need to generate C code to handle the errors on C's side.


## Crates

* `unextendr`: a simple wrapper around R's C API
* `unextendr-bindgen`: a crate for generating C and R bindings from Rust code
* `unextendr-macro`: a crate for `#[unextendr]` macro, which is powered by `unextendr-bindgen`

## Example functions

A toy example R package can be found in `R-package/` directory.

```{r}
library(unextendr)

to_upper(c("a", NA, "A", "座布団一枚"))
times_two_int(c(1L, NA, 100L, 0L, -1L))
times_two_numeric(c(1.1, NA, 0.0, Inf, -Inf))
flip_logical(c(TRUE, FALSE, NA))
print_list(list(1:10, a = letters, b = c(TRUE, FALSE), `たかし` = list(), D = NULL))
```

## TODOs

- [ ] Support Attribute and names
- [ ] Support list
- [ ] Support ALTREP
- [x] Use proc-macro
- [x] `R_UnwindProtect()`
