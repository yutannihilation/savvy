# On Windows, link.exe fails when the artifact contains unresolved symbols
# (i.e., R's API, which cannot be used without a real R session). This option
# makes the linker ignore these problems.
#
# This setting is needed only when you run `cargo test`, not when `R CMD check`
# etc. The `.cargo` directory need to be excluded on building the package (i.e.
# add `^src/rust/\.cargo$` to `.Rbuildignore`) because otherwise you'll get the
# "hidden files and directories" NOTE.
