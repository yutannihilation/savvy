[profile.release]
# By default, on release build, savvy terminates the R session when a panic
# occurs. This is the right behavior in that a panic means such a fatal event
# where we can have no hope of recovery. 
# 
# cf. https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch09-03-to-panic-or-not-to-panic.html
# 
# However, it's possible that the panic is thrown by some of the dependency
# crate and there's little you can do. In such cases, you can change the
# following line to `panic = "unwind"` to always catch a panic. Or,
# altenatively, you can wrap the part of your code by std::panic::catch_unwind
# by yourself.
panic = "abort"
