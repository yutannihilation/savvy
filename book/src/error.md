# Error handling

To propagate your errors to the R session, you can return a `savvy::Error`. You
can easily create it by using `.into()` on a `&str` containing the error message.

```rust
/// @export
#[savvy]
fn raise_error() -> savvy::Result<savvy::Sexp> {
    Err("This is my custom error".into())
}
```

```r
raise_error()
#> Error: This is my custom error
```

For the implementation details of the internals, please refer to [my blog
post](https://yutani.rbind.io/post/dont-panic-we-can-unwind/#implementation).

# Dealing with `panic!`

## First of all, don't use `panic!`

If you are familiar with extendr, you might get used to use `panic!` casually.
But, in the savvy framework, `panic!` crashes your R session. So, please don't
use `panic!` directly. Also, please avoid operations that can cause `panic!`
(e.g., `unrwap()`) when you are unsure.

This is because, in Rust, the meaning of `panic!` is an [unrecoverable
error][panic]. In theory, it's a sign that something impossible happens and
there's no hope of recovery so there should be no way but to terminate the
entire session. Savvy just respects what is supposed to happen.

[panic]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch09-01-unrecoverable-errors-with-panic.html

But, if the session terminates immediately, it's hard to investigate the cause.
What can I do?

## Use debug build

If `DEBUG` envvar is set to `true` on building (i.e., `devtools::load_all()`),
savvy catches `panic!` and shows the backtrace instead of crashing the R
session.

For example, if you write this Rust function and load it by `devtools::load_all()`,

```rust
#[savvy]
fn must_panic() -> savvy::Result<()> {
    let x = &[1];
    let _ = x[1];  // Rust's index starts from 0!
    Ok(())
}
```

you'll see such an error like this with a backtrace instead of the RStudio bomb
icon. You can check the line of the file suggested in the error message to guess
what was happening.

```r
must_panic()
#> panic occured!
#> 
#> Original message:
#>     panicked at src\error_handling.rs:33:13:
#>     index out of bounds: the len is 1 but the index is 1
#> 
#> Backtrace:
#>     ...
#>       18: std::panic::catch_unwind
#>                  at /rustc/25ef9e3d85d934b27d9dada2f9dd52b1dc63bb04\library\std\src/panic.rs:142:14

#> 
#> 
#> Error: panic happened
```

## Set `panic="unwind"`

As described above, `panic!` is an unrecoverable error. It should not be
recovered on the release build in principle.

That said, in some cases, `panic!` happens from the code out of your control.
For example, if it is thrown by some of the dependency crates, there's litte you
can do. You should report the author about the problem, but it's not always the
behavior is fixed immediately and the fixed version is published. Also, keep in
mind that depending on what originates the error, some authors can deliberately
prefer to use `panic!` instead of `Result`.
Note that `panic!` also happens in rust std library in situations such as division
by zero or out-of-bounds error when indexing a `Vec`.

In such cases, you can change the following setting included in the template
`Cargo.toml` generated by `savvy-cli init`. Set this to `panic = "unwind"`
to gracefully convert a panic into an R error just like the debug build.
Note that the backtrace is not available on the release build because
there's no debug info.

```toml
[profile.release]
# ...snip...
panic = "unwind"
```
