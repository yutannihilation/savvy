# Comparison with extendr

## What the hell is this?? Why do you need another framework when there's extendr?

[extendr](https://extendr.github.io/) is great and ready to use! However, I needed
to create a new, simple framework to experiment with. The main goal of savvy is to
provide a simpler option other than extendr, not to be a complete alternative to
extendr.

### Pros and cons compared to extendr

Pros:

(Now that extendr has been improved so much, I think savvy lost all the obvious pros.
Kudos to the extendr developers!)

Cos:

* savvy prefers explicitness over ergonomics
* savvy provides limited amount of APIs and might not fit for complex usages
