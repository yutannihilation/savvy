# ALTREP

You can implement an ALTREP class using savvy. 

## Disclaimer

* This feature is very experimental, so it's possible that the interface will be
  significantly changed or even removed in future.

* The current API might be a bit oversimplified. For example, you cannot stop
  the vector is materialized (i.e., allocated as a normal `SEXP` and put into
  the `data2` slot of the ALTREP object).

## Using ALTREP

Savvy currently provides only the following traits for ALTREP. The other ALTREPs
like `ALTLIST` are not supported.

* `AltInteger`
* `AltReap`
* `AltLogical`
* `AltString`

For example, consider the following struct that simply wraps a `Vec<i32>`.

```rust
struct MyAltInt(Vec<i32>);

impl MyAltInt {
    fn new(x: Vec<i32>) -> Self {
        Self(x)
    }
}
```

First, you need to implement `IntoExtPtrSexp` trait for the struct, which is
required by `Alt*` traits. This trait is what works under the hood of `#[savvy]`
when it's placed on a struct. You can just rely on the default implementation.

```rust
impl savvy::IntoExtPtrSexp for MyAltInt {}
```

Second, you need to implement one of the `Alt*` traits. More specifically, the
trait has 4 members you need to implement:

* `CLASS_NAME` is the name of the class. This is used for distinguishing the class, so
  please use a unique string.
* `PACKAGE_NAME` is the name of your package. This probably doesn't matter much.
* `length()` returns the length of the object.
* `elt(i)` returns the `i`-th element of the object. An important note is that,
  usually R handles the out-of-bound check and returns `NA` if it exceeds the
  length. So, you don't need to check the length here.

In this case, the actual data is `i32`, so let's implement `AltInteger`.

``` rust
impl AltInteger for MyAltInt {
    const CLASS_NAME: &'static str = "MyAltInt";
    const PACKAGE_NAME: &'static str = "TestPackage";

    fn length(&mut self) -> usize {
        self.0.len()
    }

    fn elt(&mut self, i: usize) -> i32 {
        self.0[i]
}
```

Next step is a bit advanced. You need to create a definition of ALTREP class
from the above trait. This is done by the corresponding `register_alt*_class()`
function (for example, `register_altinteger_class` for an integer class). This
function generates an ALTREP class and registers it to an R session.

The registration needs to happen when an R session loads the DLL of your crate.
As explained in the section of [initialization routine](./initialization_routine.md),
you can define a `#[savvy_init]` function, which will be called in the 
initialization routine.

``` rust
#[savvy_init]
fn init_altrep_class(dll_info: *mut DllInfo) -> savvy::Result<()> {
    register_altinteger_class::<MyAltInt>(dll_info)?;
    Ok(())
}
```

Finally, you'll probably want to implement a user-visible function to create the
instance of the ALTREP class. You can convert the struct into an ALTREP by
`.into_altrep()` method, which is provided by the `Alt*` trait. For example, you
can create the following function that returns the length 3 of the ALTREP vector
to the R session.

``` rust
#[savvy]
fn altint() -> savvy::Result<savvy::Sexp> {
    let v = MyAltInt::new(vec![1, 2, 3]);
    let v_altrep = v.into_altrep()?;
    Ok(savvy::Sexp(v_altrep))
}
```

This function can be used like this:

``` r
x <- altint()

x
#> [1] 1 2 3
```

This looks like a normal integer vector, but this is definitely an ALTREP.

```r
.Internal(inspect(x))
#> @0x0000021684acac40 13 INTSXP g0c0 [REF(65535)] (MyAltInt)
```
