# Integer, Real, String, And Bool

## Integer and real

In cases of integer (`IntegerSexp`, `OwnedIntegerSexp`) and real (`RealSexp`,
`OwnedRealSexp`), the internal representation of the SEXPs match with the Rust
type we expect, i.e., `i32` and `f64`. By taking this advantage, these types has
more methods than other types:

* `as_slice()` and `as_mut_slice()`
* `Index` and `IndexMut`
* efficient `TryFrom<&[T]>`

### `as_slice()` and `as_mut_slice()`

These types can expose its underlying C array as a Rust slice by `as_slice()`.
`as_mut_slice()` is available only for the owned versions. So, you don't need to
use `to_vec()` to create a new vector just to pass the data to the function that
requires slice. 

```rust
#[savvy]
fn foo(x: IntegerSexp) -> savvy::Result<()> {
    some_function_takes_slice(x.as_slice());
    Ok(())
}
```

### `Index` and `IndexMut`

You can also access to the underlying data by `[`. These methods are available
only for the owned versions. This means you can write assignment operation like
below instead of `set_elt()`.

```rust
#[savvy]
fn times_two(x: IntegerSexp) -> savvy::Result<savvy::Sexp> {
    let mut out = OwnedIntegerSexp::new(x.len())?;

    for (i, &v) in x.iter().enumerate() {
        out[i] = v * 2;
    }

    out.into()
}
```

### Efficient `TryFrom<&[T]>`

`TryFrom<&[T]>` is not special to real and integer, but the implementation is
different from that of logical and string; since the internal representations
are the same, savvy uses [`copy_from_slice()`][copy_from_slice], which does a
`memcpy`, to copy the data efficently (in logical and string case, the values
are copied one by one).

## Logical

While logical is 3-state (`TRUE`, `FALSE` and `NA`) on R's side, `bool` can
represent only 2 states (`true` and `false`). This mismatch is a headache. There
are many possible ways to handle this (e.g., use `Option<bool>`), but savvy
chose to convert `NA` to `true` silently, assuming `NA` is not useful on Rust's
side anyway. So, you have to make sure the input logical vector doesn't contain
`NA` on R's side. For example,

```text
wrapper_of_some_savvy_fun <- function(x) {
  out <- rep(NA, length(x))
  idx <- is.na(x)

  # apply function only non-NA elements
  out[x] <- some_savvy_fun(x[idx])

  out
}
```

If you really want to handle the 3 states, use `IntegerSexp` as the argument type
and convert the logical into an integer before calling the savvy function. To
represent 3-state, the internal representation of `LGLSXP` is int, which is the
same as `INTSXP`. So, the conversion should be cheap.

```rust
#[savvy]
fn some_savvy_fun(logical: IntegerSexp) -> savvy::Result<()> {
    for l in logical.iter() {
        if l.is_na() {
            r_print!("NA\n");
        } else if *l == 1 {
            r_print!("TRUE\n");
        } else {
            r_print!("FALSE\n");
        }
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

``` r
wrapper_of_some_savvy_fun <- function(x) {
  x <- vctrs::vec_cast(x, integer())
  some_savvy_fun(x)
}
```

## String

`STRSXP` is a vector of `CHARSXP`, not something like `*char`. So, it's not
possible to expose the internal representation as `&str`. So, it requires
several R's C API calls. To get a `&str`

1. `STRING_ELT()` to subset a `CHARSXP`
2. `R_CHAR()` to extract the string from `CHARSXP`

Similarly, to set a `&str`

1. `Rf_mkCharLenCE()` to convert `&str` to a `CHARSEXP`
2. `SET_STRING_ELT()` to put the `CHARSXP` to the `STRSXP`

This is a bit costly. So, if the strings need to be referenced and updated
frequently, probably you should avoid using `OwnedStringSexp` as a substitute of
`Vec<String>`.

### Encoding and `'static` lifetime

While Rust's string is UTF-8, R's string is not guaranteed to be UTF-8. R
provides `Rf_translateCharUTF8()` to convert the string to UTF-8. However, savvy
chose not to use it. There are two reasons:

1. As of version 4.2.0, R uses UTF-8 as the native encoding even on Windows
   systems. While old Windows systems are not the case, I bravely assumes it's
   rare and time will solve.
2. The result of `R_CHAR()` is the string stored in `R_StringHash`, [the global
   `CHARSXP` cache][charsxp-cache]. In my understanding, this will never be
   removed during the session. So, this allows savvy to mark the result `&str`
   with `'static` lifetime. However, the result of `Rf_translateCharUTF8()` is
   on an `R_alloc()`-ed memory ([code][Rf_translateCharUTF8]), which can be
   claimed by GC.
   
In short, in order to stick with `'static` lifetime for the sake of simplicity,
I decided to neglect relatively-rare case. Note that, invalid UTF-8 charactars
are rejected (= currently, silently replaced with `""`) by `CStr`, so it's not
very unsafe.
