# Integer, Real, String, Logical, Raw, And Complex

## Integer and real

In cases of integer (`IntegerSexp`, `OwnedIntegerSexp`) and real (`RealSexp`,
`OwnedRealSexp`), the internal representation of the SEXPs match with the Rust
type we expect, i.e., `i32` and `f64`. By taking this advantage, these types has
more methods than other types:

* `as_slice()` and `as_mut_slice()`
* `Index` and `IndexMut`
* efficient `TryFrom<&[T]>`

### `as_slice()` and `as_mut_slice()`

These types can expose its underlying C array as a Rust slice by `as_slice()`.
`as_mut_slice()` is available only for the owned versions. So, you don't need to
use `to_vec()` to create a new vector just to pass the data to the function that
requires slice. 

```rust
/// @export
#[savvy]
fn foo(x: IntegerSexp) -> savvy::Result<()> {
    some_function_takes_slice(x.as_slice());
    Ok(())
}
```

### `Index` and `IndexMut`

You can also access to the underlying data by `[`. These methods are available
only for the owned versions. This means you can write assignment operation like
below instead of `set_elt()`.

```rust
/// @export
#[savvy]
fn times_two(x: IntegerSexp) -> savvy::Result<savvy::Sexp> {
    let mut out = OwnedIntegerSexp::new(x.len())?;

    for (i, &v) in x.iter().enumerate() {
        if v.is_na() {
            out[i] = i32::na();
        } else {
            out[i] = v * 2;
        }
    }

    out.into()
}
```

### Efficient `TryFrom<&[T]>`

`TryFrom<&[T]>` is not special to real and integer, but the implementation is
different from that of logical and string; since the internal representations
are the same, savvy uses [`copy_from_slice()`][copy_from_slice], which does a
`memcpy`, to copy the data efficently (in logical and string case, the values
are copied one by one).

[copy_from_slice]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.slice.html#method.copy_from_slice


### `NumericSexp`

It's ideal to ensure the function takes the expected type on R's side (e.g., you
can use `vctrs::vec_cast()`, or define S3 methods for integer and double
separately). But, it's not always possible.

You can use `NumericSexp` to accept both real and integer. `NumericSexp`
provides a method to get either `i32` or `f64` values:

* `as_slice_i32()` returns `&[i32]`. This is fallible.
* `as_slice_f64()` returns `&[f64]`.
* `iter_i32()` returns an iterator of `Result<i32>`.
* `iter_f64()` returns an iterator of `f64`.

These functions return the underlying data directly if the type is the same as
wanted, otherwise converts the values. If the conversion is from `f64` to `i32`,
it fails when any of the values is

- `Inf` or `-Inf`
- out of range for `i32`
- not integer-ish (e.g. `1.1`)

For convenience, `NumericSexp` also provides `iter_usize()`, which returns an
iterator of `Result<usize>`.

With `NumericSexp`, you can rewrite the above `times_two` function like this:

```rust
#[savvy]
fn times_two(x: NumericSexp) -> savvy::Result<Sexp> {
    let mut out = OwnedIntegerSexp::new(x.len())?;

    for (i, v) in x.iter_i32().enumerate() {
        let v = v?;
        if v.is_na() {
            out[i] = i32::na();
        } else {
            out[i] = v * 2;
        }
    }

    out.into()
}
```

Alternatively, you can use `.into_typed()` and `match` the result to apply an
appropriate function depneding on the type. In this case, you need to define two
different functions, but this might be useful when the logic is very different
for integer values and real values.

```rust
#[savvy]
fn times_two(x: NumericSexp) -> savvy::Result<savvy::Sexp> {
    match x.into_typed() {
        NumericTypedSexp::Integer(i) => times_two_int(i),
        NumericTypedSexp::Real(r) => times_two_real(r),
    }
}
```

## Logical

While logical is 3-state (`TRUE`, `FALSE` and `NA`) on R's side, `bool` can
represent only 2 states (`true` and `false`). This mismatch is a headache. There
are many possible ways to handle this (e.g., use `Option<bool>`), but savvy
chose to convert `NA` to `true` silently, assuming `NA` is not useful on Rust's
side anyway. So, you have to make sure the input logical vector doesn't contain
`NA` on R's side. For example,

```r
wrapper_of_some_savvy_fun <- function(x) {
  out <- rep(NA, length(x))
  idx <- is.na(x)

  # apply function only non-NA elements
  out[x] <- some_savvy_fun(x[idx])

  out
}
```

If you really want to handle the 3 states, use an expert-only method
`as_slice_raw()`. This returns `&[i32]` instead of `&[bool]`. Why `i32`? It's
the internal representation of a logical vector, which is the same as an integer
vector. By treating the data as `i32`, you can use `is_na()`.

```rust
use savvy::NotAvailableValue;   // for is_na()

/// @export
#[savvy]
fn flip_logical_expert_only(x: LogicalSexp) -> savvy::Result<savvy::Sexp> {
    let mut out = OwnedLogicalSexp::new(x.len())?;

    for (i, e) in x.as_slice_raw().iter().enumerate() {
        if e.is_na() {
            out.set_na(i)?;
        } else {
            out.set_elt(i, *e != 1)?; // 1 means TRUE
        }
    }

    out.into()
}
```

```r
flip_logical_expert_only(c(TRUE, FALSE, NA))
#> [1]  TRUE FALSE    NA
```

## String

`STRSXP` is a vector of `CHARSXP`, not something like `*char`. So, it's not
possible to expose the internal representation as `&str`. So, it requires
several R's C API calls. To get a `&str`

1. `STRING_ELT()` to subset a `CHARSXP`
2. `R_CHAR()` to extract the string from `CHARSXP`

Similarly, to set a `&str`

1. `Rf_mkCharLenCE()` to convert `&str` to a `CHARSEXP`
2. `SET_STRING_ELT()` to put the `CHARSXP` to the `STRSXP`

This is a bit costly. So, if the strings need to be referenced and updated
frequently, probably you should avoid using `OwnedStringSexp` as a substitute of
`Vec<String>`.

### Encoding and `'static` lifetime

While Rust's string is UTF-8, R's string is not guaranteed to be UTF-8. R
provides `Rf_translateCharUTF8()` to convert the string to UTF-8. However, savvy
chose not to use it. There are two reasons:

1. As of version 4.2.0, R uses UTF-8 as the native encoding even on Windows
   systems. While old Windows systems are not the case, I bravely assumes it's
   rare and time will solve.
2. The result of `R_CHAR()` is the string stored in `R_StringHash`, [the global
   `CHARSXP` cache][charsxp-cache]. In my understanding, this will never be
   removed during the session. So, this allows savvy to mark the result `&str`
   with `'static` lifetime. However, the result of `Rf_translateCharUTF8()` is
   on an `R_alloc()`-ed memory ([code][Rf_translateCharUTF8]), which can be
   claimed by GC.
   
In short, in order to stick with `'static` lifetime for the sake of simplicity,
I decided to neglect relatively-rare case. Note that, invalid UTF-8 charactars
are rejected (= currently, silently replaced with `""`) by `CStr`, so it's not
very unsafe.

## Raw

A raw vector is the sequence of `u8`, which can be used for representing various
binary data. But, please be aware that you can use a Rust struct (see [the
section about struct](./struct.md)) to store the data instead of copying the
whole data into R's memory.

## Complex

Complex is optionally supported under feature flag `complex`. If it's enabled,
you can use `ComplexSexp` and `OwnedComplexSexp` to use a complex vector for
input or output, and you can extract the slice of `num_complex::Complex64` from
it.

```rust
/// @export
#[savvy]
fn abs_complex(x: savvy::ComplexSexp) -> savvy::Result<savvy::Sexp> {
    let mut out = savvy::OwnedRealSexp::new(x.len())?;

    for (i, c) in x.iter().enumerate() {
        if !c.is_na() {
            out[i] = (c.re * c.re + c.im * c.im).sqrt();
        } else {
            out.set_na(i)?;
        }
    }

    out.into()
}
```
